        <h2 class="content" id="intro">Introduction</h3>
            <p class="content"><span>S</span>trawberries are sweet supple red fruits with surfaces that are seed-<br>
                studded. They come from a low-growing plant belonging to genus<br>
                Fragaria of the rose (Rosaceae) family, enclosing white flowers, lobed<br>
                foliage, and runners. They originate all through the north temperate zones.<br>
                <br>
                They are the most famous and trendiest fruits in the planet (Roger). There<br>
                are over 600 assortments of strawberries that vary in taste, size, and feel;<br>
                all of which have similar trait; heart silhouette, red fleshy tissue with yellow<br>
                seeds shooting the surface, petite, royal, leafy green lids, and stalk that<br>
                embellish their crowns (WHFoods). Below is picture of the strawberry fruit.<br>

        <h2 class="content" id="history">Detailed History</h3>
            <p class="content">The word strawberry is coined from ‘strewn” berries about the plants and<br>
                thus the “strewn berry” finally turned into “Strawberry” (Roger). They are<br>
                not actual fruits or berries but distended ends of the stamen of the plant.<br>
                The seeds are on the external surface, rather than the internal berry. There<br>
                are around 200 seeds for each berry. They are low in calories and are<br>
                non-fat, loaded with vitamin c, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B6 and potassium (Roger).<br>
                <br>
                Over the years they have been utilized as medications for ailments like,<br>
                stained teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopley, 9). Strawberries<br>
                were served up at medieval state occasions as a show of peace, wealth,<br>
                and excellence. The most well-known communal intake of strawberries is<br>
                at Wimbledon annually, when strawberries and cream are eaten by very<br>
                well attired Englishmen in the middle of tennis games (Hopley, 9).<br>

        <h2 class="content" id="uses">Various Uses Of Strawberries</h3>
            <p class="content">Strawberries have numerous uses. One of the most famous uses of<br>
                strawberries is being used as recipe or an ingredient in preparation of<br>
                drinks, meals or snacks. Strawberries are used as ingredients in many<br>
                types of foods like cakes, yoghurts, desserts, salads, juices, meals and<br>
                chocolates.<br>
